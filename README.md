# hackernews_angular-assignment

## ONGOING

Recreate the newsfeed on HackerNews (https://news.ycombinator.com/).

The objectives of this assignment are the following:
1. Please use the HackerNews API to load articles - https://github.com/HackerNews/API
2. No need to re-create the up-voting and/or commenting feature - instead, link to the real hacker news comment page
3. Do not use jQuery - please use raw vanilla JS. When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, please load another 30 posts using Ajax (and append them to the bottom of the page)
4. Make the page mobile responsive, just like HackerNews
5. No need to re-create search (at the bottom).
6. Do not use a table layout - we will be judging you based on your ability to re-create a clean responsive UI. That said, feel free to use Bootstrap and/or Foundation.
